# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
In the highly competitive telecom industry, customer retention is critical. With an average annual churn rate of 15-25% and the cost of acquiring new customers being 5-10 times higher than retaining existing ones, telecom companies are increasingly focusing on reducing customer churn. This project aims to analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm to identify customers at high risk of churn and to determine the main indicators of churn.

## Business Goal
The primary goal of this project is to build predictive models that can accurately identify high-risk customers and understand the key factors contributing to customer churn. This will enable telecom operators to implement targeted strategies for retaining their most profitable customers.
